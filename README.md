# HyakumanbenExercise
The repository is made for Hyakumanben exercise in Transportation Management Engineering 2020 Fall.  
By running carSolver.py, you can solve values of degree of saturations, total waiting time, and total queue for different green time inputs.  
For different stage design, you can edit generateCSV.py and create a new signal timing plan.
